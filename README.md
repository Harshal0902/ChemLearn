# Chem Learn

We all know how thought to under and the complex and difficult structures in the chemistry. And we all have experienced online classes are monotonous, the concept taught is not retrainable and practical are most important for subjects like chemistry, etc which require physical practice and visualization.

## Live demo

The site is deployed through Vercel, which you can view from [here](https://chemfun.vercel.app/)

## Demo video

## 💡 Inspiration

We all know how thought to under and the complex and difficult structures in chemistry. And we all have experienced online classes are monotonous, the concept taught is not retrainable and practical are most important for subjects like chemistry, etc which require physical practice and visualization.

## 💻 What it does

Chem Learn is an AR-based web platform where students come across and learn about various complex chemical structures. Learn with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR. Chem Learn can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter.

## 🔨 How we built it

- React Js: For the frontend
- TypeScript: Frontend using React Typescript
- Firebase: For user authentication and database
- Three Js: For rendering 3D Models
- Tailwind CSS: For styling

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which I overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing the project under the given time frame

## 📖 What we learned

Working with three js and using echoAR

## 🚀 What's next for Chem Learn

- Add Virtual Reality (VR) functionality
- Add more subjects and Customized 3D models
